\begin{rSection}{Interests}
	I am interested in graph theory and would like to work on topics related to graph algorithms and structural graph theory. In addition, I am also keen on topics related to discrete optimization.

\begin{rSubsection}{Relevant Projects}{}{}{}	
	\item \textbf{Bounded queue-number in planar graphs (CS762)}\\
	I explored a recent proof by Dujmovi\'{c} et al \cite{queue} for a 20-year old conjectjure on whether the queue-number of planar graphs is bounded. I also wrote lecture notes and made a lecture video on the topic.\\

	\item \textbf{Deciding tangles with weighted vertex sets (CO749)}\\
	I wrote a report on Elbracht et al.'s fractional solution \cite{tangle} to an open problem about finding a vertex subset that characterizes a tangle by a majority vote. In addition, I also explored Oum and Seymour's paper \cite{branchwidth} on certifying large branch-width in polynomial time with tangle-kits.
