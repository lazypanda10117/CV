\begin{rSection}{Interests}
I am interested in graph theory and graph algorithms research, with a particular interest in structural graph theory, graph drawing, and graph colouring. In addition, I am also keen on quantum computing and hope to learn more through courses like quantum information processing and algebraic graph theory in the future.
