\begin{rSection}{Interests}
	% UWaterloo version
	I am interested in graph theory and graph algorithms research, with a particular interest in structural graph theory and graph colouring. In addition, I am also keen on topics related to discrete optimization.
	% EPFL version
	% I am interested in graph theory and its applications, particularly in structural graph theory and optimization on graph structures. In addition, I am also keen on complexity theory and machine learning theory, which I hope to learn more the Formal Languages and Neural Networks courses in the upcoming semester.

\begin{rSubsection}{Relevant Projects}{}{}{}
	\item \textbf{Bounded Queue-number in Planar Graphs (CS762)} \\ 
	% - \href{https://jeffreyhykam.com/writings/}{Project Page}\\
	Explore a recent proof by Dujmovi\'{c} et al for a 20-year old conjectjure on whether the queue-number of planar graph is bounded. \\

	\item \textbf{Tangles are Decided by Weighted Vertex Sets (CO749)} \\
	 % - \href{https://jeffreyhykam.com/writings/}{Project Page}\\
	Explore a partial solution by Elbracht et al to an open problem by Diestel, who asked whether we can find a vertex subset $X$ that can definitively characterize a tangle by seeing which side of a low order separation has more vertices in $X$. 
	% We further explore the possibility improving the weight function to be polynomially-bounded by the number of vertices.
